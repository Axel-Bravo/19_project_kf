# Kaggle & Fun
This is the wiki of the __Kaggle&Fun__ project, a project personally driven at my company in order to make profit my colleagues and friends and the _power and fun_ one can have while solving deep learning challenges. The basic approach is to provide a basic foundation of what deep learning is in order to be able to move as quick as possible into the practice of kaggle challenges, as practice makes mastery. 

This git is used in order to agglutinate all material presented in class, tasks to realize as well as organize the code to be available to participants.

## Current challenge:
Kaggle __Plant Seedings Classification__ [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data)
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?

The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

### Data Description
You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The list of species is as follows:
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet
